- Hello, I'm Jack Swank. I'm a Data Analytics student at the Harriet L. Wilkes Honors College. 
My ultimate goal is to work as a data scientist where I can use the skills I've gained thus far while continuing to learn.
- Iâ€™m looking for an internship in the data science field where skills in data analytics or computer programming can be further enhanced.
